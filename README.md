#Cooldown in second before home command can be reused
#Range: > 0
shw_home_cooldown = 10
#Cooldown in second before waypoint command can be reused
#Range: > 0
shw_waypoints_cooldown = 1
#Is dimensional travel allowed for home command
shw_is_dimensional_travel_allowed_for_home = true
#Is dimensional travel allowed for waypoints command
shw_is_dimensional_travel_allowed_for_waypoints = true
#Maximum number of waypoints by player
#Range: 0 ~ 100
shw_maximum_number_of_waypoints = 10
```

This configuration file is generated at server initialization in `world/serverconfig/shw-server.toml`.

Setting a new value will take instantly effect. Restarting the server is not necessary.

Updating configuration while the server is running will not notify players.

teleport you on your home.
